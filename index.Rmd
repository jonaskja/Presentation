# Outline of Project

A simple workspace for students/researchers working with the same data (e.g. writing a paper togheter). The application consist four main options: 

1. View the data of choice
2. Get descriptive statistics of chosen variables (plot and table)
3. Perform regression analysis of chosen variables (linear and count)
4. Download the data (csv-file)

# The layout of the application  

Uses ```library(shinydashboard)``` to create the main tabs on the left hand side

# Example of functionality

- Based on the choices made by the user, the server calculates and prints the output
- All operations are reactive in the sense that the user input on the screen is pushed to the server 
- Example of reactive code in the tab "Analyze":
 
```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
  output$nbmodel.table <- renderTable({
    library(MASS)
    glm.nb(as.formula(paste(input$dependent," ~ ",paste(input$independent,collapse="+"))),data=Data)
  })           
``` 

If the variable "Goals" is chosen as dependent and "Behav_aut" as only independent, the server run this model:
```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
  Data <- read.csv2("Data.csv")
  library(MASS)
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
glm.nb(Goals ~ Behav_aut,data=Data)
          
``` 


---

# Example of functionality - continued

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
glm.nb(Goals ~ Behav_aut,data=Data)
          
``` 


The renderTable function create the object output$nbmodel.table which is printed using tableOutput("nbmodel.table").
